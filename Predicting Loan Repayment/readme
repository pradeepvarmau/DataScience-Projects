# README: Loan Repayment Outcomes Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains information on loans issued to borrowers, with the aim of predicting loan repayment outcomes. The primary target variable is whether a loan was fully paid or not. This analysis focuses on the application of various machine learning algorithms to classify loans into two categories: fully paid and not fully paid.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

| Column Name         | Description                                                                                                                                     |

| `dti`               | The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).                                                             |
| `fico`              | The FICO credit score of the borrower.                                                                                                         |
| `days.with.cr.line` | The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.                                                                                         |
| `revol.bal`        | The revolving balance of the borrower (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).                                              |
| `revol.util`        | The revolving utilization rate (the amount of credit line used relative to total credit available).                                             |
| `inq.last.6mths`    | The number of inquiries made by creditors in the last 6 months.                                                                                 |
| `delinq.2yrs`       | The number of times the borrower has been delinquent on payments in the last 2 years.                                                         |
| `pub.rec`           | The number of derogatory public records of the borrower (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).                                         |
