# Data Science Projects by [pradeepvarmau]

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is a collection of data science projects I‚Äôve worked on, focusing on practical machine learning and data analysis techniques. These projects reflect my expertise in various tools and algorithms to solve real-world problems.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a data enthusiast with a passion for solving complex problems using data-driven approaches. My projects range from building recommendation systems to classification models for predictive analytics. I enjoy working with large datasets and applying machine learning algorithms to uncover insights and predictions.

## üî¨ Projects

### 1. Movie Recommendation System
This project uses both collaborative filtering and content-based methods to recommend movies based on user preferences. It demonstrates an understanding of machine learning and data wrangling techniques in the context of recommendation engines.

**Tech Stack**: Python, pandas,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib, scikit-learn

### 2. Loan Repayment Classification
In this project, I built a classification model to predict loan repayment status based on customer features. The project involves using various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. I implemented techniques like K-Fold Cross Validation and GridSearchCV for model tuning and evaluation.

**Tools & Algorithms**: 
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Algorithms: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, SVM
- Techniques: K-Fold Cross Validation, GridSearchCV
